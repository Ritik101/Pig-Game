1) User rolls dice
	When the user/player clicks on the roll dice button then we need to generate a random dice roll, 
	then we display the dice roll and then we check whether it is a 1 if it is not a 1 then we add dice 
	roll to the current score and of course display it. If the dice roll is actually 1 then simply switch 
	the player and so in this case the dice roll won't get added to the total score.

2) User hold dice
	When the user/player wants to hold the score and clicks on the hold button after doing which 
	the current score gets added to the total score. Once that is done we must check if the total 
	score is above or equal 100 because the player wins whenever the score is atleast 100.  

3) User resets game
	When the user/player clicks on the NEW GAME button the game resets and all the values 
	go back default values.
